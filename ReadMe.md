## Running the program
### The visualizer
To run the program, including the visualizer, run the RocketToTitan.jar file. Alternatively, one can also run the program by running the Main.java class from within an IDE.
### Trajectory approximation
If one wants to find the optimal trajectory of a probe from Earth to Titan and back, the ProbeLauncher.java class should be used. It does not run the visualizer, as its purpose is to approximate the initial boost velocities requiered to get to Titan and return to Earth, providing the data in the form of text in the terminal. The easiest way to access the class is running it from one's preferred IDE, or alternatively using the following command: 
`>>java ProbeLauncher.java`
